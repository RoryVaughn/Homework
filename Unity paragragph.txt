Unity

Unity is a game engine Unity Technologies and can be used to develop game for quite a few platforms.
It is an easy software to use and alllows you to use different coding languages and assets to create games.
In the tutorial, I created a game with a ball to creat a small game that allowed the player to roll the ball
 around and collect squares for points. I used the colliders to ensure that the shapes interacted correctly.
I also got a refresher of my previous experience in C#.
